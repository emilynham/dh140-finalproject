August 5, 2024

Sabrina Carpenter, now a top 10 Spotify artist with nearly 80 million monthly listeners, has built her music career steadily since her debut in 2015. Fascinated by her journey, I investigated the evolution of sentiment in her song lyrics to understand if changes in sentiment correlate with her rising popularity. This analysis explores the relationship between lyrical sentiment and streaming numbers and predicts the sentiment of her upcoming sixth studio album, *Short n’ Sweet*. The research focuses on how Carpenter's lyrical sentiment has changed over time and how it relates to streaming patterns, as well as what can be anticipated about the sentiment of her new album based on previous data and current releases.
